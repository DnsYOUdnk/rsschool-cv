## Aboute me
  I am 28 years old. For a long time  worked in the industrial sphere as a design engineer. An interesting job, but over time it became clear that this is not my profession. I like the specifics of website development, so Frontend is my desire to learn something new and continue searching for myself. I am quite diligent and able-bodied. If I see the structure of the problem, I am ready to work until it is completed. I can't say that I catch everything quickly, but I'm ready for a painstaking path to gain new knowledge.

## My hobbies
  Various types of hobbies are gradually entering my life. I am engaged in cycling. It was only after school that I realized that I adore reading books. I love the Star Wars universe, except for the last trilogy. I follow the latest technologies, as well as what is happening there, in space. A new interest is playing the ukulele.
